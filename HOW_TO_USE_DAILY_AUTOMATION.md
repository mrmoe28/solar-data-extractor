## 🚀 How to Run This Daily

### Option 1: Fully Automated (Recommended)

Tell me:
```
"Find Georgia solar leads daily at 8 AM and auto-submit Hot ones"
```

I'll set up a cron job that:
1. Searches all platforms every morning
2. Extracts and scores new leads
3. Auto-submits qualified leads to your form
4. Emails you a daily report like today's
5. Tracks everything in CSV files

### Option 2: Manual Daily Run

Every morning, tell me:
```
"Find solar leads in Georgia and submit to my form"
```

I'll execute the full workflow and give you results.

### Option 3: Run the Script Yourself

```bash
cd ~/solar-data-extractor
./daily-lead-automation.sh
```

Then let me process the automation (I'll see the script ran and execute).

```

**When you call:**
1. Get their real email
2. Update your CRM
3. Send follow-up materials

### Phone Numbers
Not all leads have phone numbers posted.

**Priority order:**
1. Call if phone number was extracted
2. Message them on the platform (you have the profile link)
3. Reply to their original post

### Privacy & Ethics
- ✅ Only public posts
- ✅ They're actively seeking help
- ✅ You're providing a service they requested
- ✅ Fast response is APPRECIATED
- ❌ Not spam (they wanted this!)
