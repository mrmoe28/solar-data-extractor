## 🚀 How to Use (3 Easy Methods)

### METHOD 1: Fully Automated (Recommended)
**Set it and forget it - leads flow directly to your inbox**

```bash
# Run once per day (or set up cron job)
```

Tell Claude:
```
"Find solar installation leads in Georgia and auto-submit Hot leads to my form"
```

**What happens:**
1. Claude searches Facebook, Reddit, HomeAdvisor, etc.
2. Finds 50+ leads
3. Scores each one (Hot/Warm/Cold)
4. Auto-submits Hot & Warm leads (score 40+) to your form
5. You get emails: "New consultation request from John Smith..."

**Your work:** Just respond to the emails!

---

### METHOD 2: Semi-Automated (More Control)
**Review leads before submission**

Tell Claude:
```
"Find solar leads in Georgia, show me the Hot ones, then I'll approve submission"
```

**What happens:**
1. Claude extracts and scores leads
2. Shows you top 10 Hot leads
3. You say "submit these 5"
4. Claude auto-fills and submits to your form

**Your work:** 30 seconds to review, 0 seconds to submit

---

### METHOD 3: Manual Review (Full Control)
**Extract only, you handle submission**

Tell Claude:
```
"Find solar leads in Georgia and save to CSV"
```

**What happens:**
1. Claude extracts leads
2. Saves to CSV with all details
3. You manually review and contact

**Your work:** Traditional approach, but with better lead sources

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Email Handling
Many leads won't have email addresses (they posted on Facebook/Reddit). The system uses placeholder emails like:

```
lead-facebook-1234567890@pending-contact.com
```

**When you call the lead:**
1. Ask for their real email
2. Update your CRM
3. Send follow-up materials

### Phone Numbers
Not all leads will have phone numbers posted. Priority order:
1. Use extracted phone if available
2. Get it from their profile (you have the link)
3. Ask when they respond to your message on the platform

### Privacy & Ethics
- ✅ Only public posts
- ✅ They're asking for help
- ✅ You're providing a service
- ✅ Fast response is APPRECIATED
- ❌ Not spam (they wanted this!)
